# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Description
Event Mania is a comprehensive social event management website developed using React, React Router, Tailwind CSS, DaisyUI, Material Tailwind, and Firebase. The website facilitates the planning of various events such as birthday parties, anniversaries, weddings, retirement parties, baby showers, and engagement parties. The home page features a navbar, banner/slider, services section, follow us on Instagram, newsletter, and a footer. The Services section showcases at least 6 event services with relevant details. Users can click on specific services to view detailed information on a protected route. The website includes email and password-based authentication with registration and login pages. The registration page displays errors for password criteria, and the login page displays errors for password and email mismatches. Google login is also implemented. Upon successful authentication, the user's name, profile picture, and logout button appear on the header. The website has additional private routes, a 404 page, and supports a dark and light theme toggle mode in the navbar.
